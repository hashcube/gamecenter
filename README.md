iOS Gamecenter Plugin for Gameclosure


This is a plugin for the Gameclosure Game Development Engine for mobile apps. (www.gameclosure.com)

This plugin is for implementing iOS Gamecenter in a game built on Gameclosure.

Currently this allows a person to send scores to leaderboard and send achievement completion.

The incremental achievements are not included. But it can be very easy to do. Right now all the acievements are sent with percentage completion of 100.0. This value can be changed for incremental upgrades.
